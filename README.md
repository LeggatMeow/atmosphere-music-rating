# atmosphere-ratings (prototype)

This is a ready-to-run Vite + React prototype for rating Atmosphere tracks (1â€“5 stars with half-star support).

Quick start:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
The app uses localStorage to persist ratings per song.

Albums included (seeded):
- God Loves Ugly (2002)
- Seven's Travels (2003)
- Southsiders (2014)

Feel free to edit `src/data/bandData.js` to add more albums or tracks.
